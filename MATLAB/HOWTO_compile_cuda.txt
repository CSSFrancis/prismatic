Example for compiling CUDA code that is then used in MEX functions. I couldn't
get mexcuda to work with CUDA 8.0, so instead this compiles a shared object
with nvcc and then links it with MEX. A bit of a pain, but works

First generate a shared option with
nvcc -Xcompiler -fPIC  -c timesTwo.cu -arch=sm_35 -std=c++11

then mex with
mex timesTwo.cpp timesTwo.o LINKLIBS='$LINKLIBS -lcudart -L /usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64'
