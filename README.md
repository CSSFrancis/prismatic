# PRISM
C++/CUDA implementation of compact S-matrix formulism for fast Multislice simulation of electron micrographs. PRISM is capable of producing simulated micrographs with tolerable error compared with the original implementation by [Kirkland](http://people.ccmr.cornell.edu/~kirkland/) while providing computational acceleration of over ###x.


## Installation
PRISM is built on top of [CMake](https://cmake.org/), a cross-platform compilation utility that allows a single source tree to be compiled into a variety of formats including UNIX Makefiles, Microsoft Visual Studio projects, Mac OS XCode projects, etc. Only having to maintain one project means PR
